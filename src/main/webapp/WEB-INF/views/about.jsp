                    <strong>Welcome to Coffe-e!</strong><br>
                    Are you tired of the same old drip coffee? Are you looking to elevate your coffee game and experience
                    new flavors and aromas? Look no further! We are here to help you discover the joys of manual brewing.
                    Manual brewing is the art of brewing coffee using methods that require more attention and care than
                    automatic drip machines. With manual brewing, you can control variables like water temperature,
                    grind size, and brewing time to create a cup of coffee that perfectly suits your taste.
                    Two popular manual brewing methods are the V60 and Chemex. These methods require a few tools and some
                    patience, but the results are well worth the effort. Here's what you'll need to get started with V60
                    or Chemex brewing:
                    For V60 brewing:

                    * V60 filter
                    * Gooseneck kettle
                    * Coffee scale
                    * Coffee grinder
                    * Freshly roasted coffee beans
                    For Chemex brewing:
                    * Chemex brewer
                    * Chemex filter
                    * Gooseneck kettle
